### TODO items

This file contains a few miscellaneous items that are too small
to be added as Github issues.

- **Uniform notation for #include statements.**  Currently, include statements
use a mix of `<filename.hpp>` angle brackets and `"filename.hpp"` quotation marks.
We should ensure that the choices are systematic/correct.
